Write up: in Project 1, we focused on building a simulated corporate environment using object-oriented Python programming. This involved creating a dynamic structure of stores, customers, and orders, all contributing to a realistic dataset. By defining objects like Store, Customer, Order, and Product, we replicated real-world business operations, generating diverse data points, such as product purchases, customer orders, and store activities. A CSV file was then created to store the generated sales data, capturing essential details like store IDs, customer IDs, order IDs, product names, prices, and timestamps. This foundational work not only set the stage for advanced analysis but also demonstrated the power of Python in simulating and managing complex organizational datasets for future insights.
